  // SYNC[1] waits for all preceding instructions to complete before any
  // subsequent instructions are initiated. It also waits until *almost* all
  // preceding memory operations have completed, with the exception of accesses
  // caused by ICBI[2].
  //
  // To wait for these last accesses, we also issue an ISYNC[3] instruction.
  // ISYNC has the same serializing effect on the instruction stream as SYNC,
  // but doesn't enforce order of any memory accesses *except* those caused by
  // a preceding ICBI.
  //
  // Of note, Linux uses `ISYNC; SYNC` as a speculation barrier on some PowerPC
  // devices: https://git.io/Je60x
